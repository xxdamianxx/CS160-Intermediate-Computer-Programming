# CS160-Intermediate-Computer-Programming
I took CS160 Intermediate Computer Programming at San Diego State University during the Fall of 2023 and wrote most of the source-code found here with my former physics tutor Ph.D. Peter Domitrovich who specialized in Multibody Theory and Quantum Dynamics. He told me that ChatGPT was useless because it made a lot of math errors and I found one by asking ChatGPT if it could help me win the Powerball Lottery, I noticed an error right away and as a joke I told ChatGPT that it was a woman. I also included code from Ph.D. David Noelle from UC Merced how greatly contributed the discovery of Artificial Intelligence.
